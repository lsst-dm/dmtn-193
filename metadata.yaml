  Presents a threat model and web security design for the Science
  Platform. Recommends approaches for the authorization system and aspect
  configuration to limit the risk of web security vulnerabilities.

# Abstract, if available
abstract: >-
  The Rubin Science Platform consists of a set of services accessed via HTTP
  with a shared authentication and security layer. The underlying applications
  will come from various sources and be written by teams with varying levels
  of knowledge of web security defenses. It also includes the Notebook Aspect,
  which is arbitrary code execution as a service and thus poses unique
  security challenges. This document proposes a threat model for thinking
  about web security for the Rubin Science Platform as a whole and discusses
  design approaches and mitigations to maximize the effective security of the
  overall platform without assuming detailed security design of each
  component.
